Translations of mining.bitcoin.cz website.

How to improve existing translations
------------------------------------

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make fix in PO file. You can use poedit software, but any text editor will work as well. Be sure you're using UTF-8 charset.
3. Make pull request in Github. Thank you!

How to add new language
-----------------------
1. Fork the repository.
2. Copy 'en' directory to new directory named by proper country code. If you're unsure with proper name, just ask.
3. Replace as many 'msgstr' strings in the PO file as you can. You don't need to translate everything, but more the better. Be sure you're using UTF-8 charset.
4. Make pull request in Github. Thank you! I'm usually sending small bitcoin donation to contributors.
